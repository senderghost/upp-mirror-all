There are some prerequisites required to build and run U++.
In debian package names, these are:

g++, make, libgtk2.0-dev, libnotify-dev, libbz2-dev, sox.

For debian/apt-get based distribution, 'debian' file contains required
dependencies in form of apt-get commands. You can use this file by running
"sh debian" as root (e.g. "sudo sh debian" if sudo is available).

Use 'make' to compile TheIDE. It will generate ~/theide (integrated development
environment) and ~/umk (commandline tool for building U++ projects).

Use 'make install' to prepare standard U++ environment. It will create ~/upp
directory to store U++ library sources, MyApps to store your application
sources and ~/upp.out as output for intermediate files and copies theide and
umk to ~.

Then start playing with U++ by invoking ~/theide (you might want to put it
elsewhere later, e.g. to ~/bin/theide).
