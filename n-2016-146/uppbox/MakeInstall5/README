Ultimate++ Windows releases

Windows release a simple archive .7z archive. Unpack to directory of your
preference, then just run theide.exe (or theide32.exe if you have 32-bit
windows). U++ does not write anything to registry or outside its directory.

U++ comes in two variants:

* upp-mingw   contains TMD64 compiler system for out of the box operation
* upp-win     comes without compiler/SDK

Both variants are able (on first install, when installation is moved or on
demand - menu Setup/Instant setup) to detect and use SDK and C++ compiler
from Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (free community edition is fine).

Note: While mingw/TDM64 is fine for light work, we really recommend using
VS2015 C++ compiler for serious work. It significantly faster and better
supported by 3rd party libraries.

When installing Visual Studion 2015, please make sure these options are checked:

* Programming languages / Visual C++
* Universal Windows App Developemtnt Tools / Tools (#) and Windows SDK (#)

(# is version number, theide should pickup any version you install)

TheIDE can also be configured to work with external mingw or older Microsoft
compilers and usually autosetup them (menu Setup/Legacy compilers automatic
setup). However, as previous version of Visual C++ do not support parts of
C++11 standard important for U++, we recommend using compiler from VS2015 (on
the other hand, current U++ will work just fine in C++98 mode with previous
Microsoft compiler)..

Known issues:

- shipped version of TDM64 has broken optimizer so the maximum working optimize
  level is -O1
